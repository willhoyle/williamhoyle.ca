We need to get to the bottom of the current economic system.

1. workers are not getting enough of the profits because
   the CEO and shareholders are taking more than they need.

Find a way to tax more? Disallow the current
tax avoidance schemes. They'll find a way to avoid it.

What would happen if enough people just started acting within this socialist/democratic framework.

Maybe it could grow and grow as more people decide they want to live in that type of society.

What will be different? I won't go as far as banning money because we need this framework to be realistic
within the confines of the capitalist society this community will grow within. So keep money. Honestly I really like a model
like france's where taxes are very high the higher you go. Penalize it but don't completely disallow it. Keeps the "competition" I guess.
I know people won't agree with me on the competition aspect. Ok so we distribute wealth a bit more. We can
offer more social services and aid.

This in turn might create healthier employer/employee relationship. Mandate enough vacation time (12 weeks). Seriously we're rich enough as a
society to have this as a mandate. Lmao look at the pandemic. The economy is still alive and no one's even working.

People will be happier and more relaxed. People will go out more and spend stuff on nice dinners and activities.

I know 12 weeks sounds crazy but think about what that could unlock! People often say everything will slow down no work will get done.

To kickstart the process. I think we get the government involved. We start with matching 50% of the vacation time salary (up to a certain amount).

Easy things and since everyone is forced to do it, it's fair and prices are competitive
