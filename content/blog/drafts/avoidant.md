# my avoidance story: a look inside my brain
## what's it's like living in constant fear with avoidant personality disorder (AvPD)

"Hey, what's your friend from uni up to these days? I think he lives here now. You should message him!", my partner asks.

"Yea I should. That's a good idea. I've been wondering the same thing". Why did I just say that? I have no intention of doing this. My avoidance strategies have developed to such a degree that, I don't even entertain the thought of messaging this person. Avoidance is on autopilot.

It scares me how quick this little lie came out of my mouth. She's the love of my life. The closest person I have. I don't share this part of me though. It's hidden away behind a carefully crafted facade. 

I guess the thought process here is, telling the truth will just lead to more questions. These questions might lead to deep-rooted, triggering questions about my past. Childhood and teenage trauma that made me the way that I am.  

"No sorry, I won't be messaging him". That'd inevitably lead to more follow-up questions.

"What? Why not? It's just a little message". I don't have the answers to those questions anymore. My avoidance strategies over the years have gone into autopilot. Now I just avoid anything that will bring up the subject of my avoidance strategies. Is this meta-avoidance? Avoid anything that might bring up the subject of my avoidance.

The worst part? I WANT to message him. I'd love to know how he's doing. I'd love to get back in touch with him. Maybe we could be friends again. But not too close of friends. That wouldn't be good. You know what? I won't message him, I shouldn't bother him. He's probably a busy guy.

What is wrong with me? I'm so afraid, all the time. What am I afraid of?

It's difficult to remember a time in my life where I wasn't actively trying to avoid people. They say people like me represent 2-7% of the population. That's a lot of people. You've probably met someone like me. We hide very well. We hide our disease. You might have thought, hmmm, that guy was quiet. It's often conflated with shyness (of which I suffer from as well).

Avoid, deflect, hide, fear, sweat, on-guard, be quiet, rejected, humiliated, pain, cringe. Avoid.

Don't stay too long. Don't show emotion. Don't make a fool of yourself. Don't dance. Don't sing. Don't sweat. Don't blush. Don't speak your mind. Don't draw attention. Don't let them see. Don't let them judge. Don't fuck it up. Just don't.

I'm exhausted. It's too hard to keep living my life like this. I've had bouts of depression most of my adolescent/adult life. I often wonder, if I didn't have my loving, incredible partner by my side, where I'd be. If I'd be. 

Don't worry, this isn't a suicide letter. That's never been an option for me. I'm a happy person.

Don't get it twisted, I've had occasional intrusive thoughts. What if I just "slipped" in front of a passing car. I have a theory that this disease protects folks like myself, with AvPD, from killing themselves. We have intense fear of being judged or failing. They'd judge me if I "offed" myself. What if I failed? That would be the most embarrassing thing that could happen to me. I can hear them whispering right now. Remember that quiet guy? He killed himself. Way too risky.

This story wouldn't be complete without delving into my past. After all, most personality disorders develop at an early age.

Where should I begin. I was always a scared child.
