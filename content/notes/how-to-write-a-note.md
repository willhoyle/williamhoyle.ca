## Creating a new note
I want it to be as easy as possible to create and maintain notes.
Every note on this page is stitched together from individual markdown files.
Just create a new file in `content/notes/new-note.md`. The build system can handle frontmatter but none of the fields are used at the moment. Commit, push and netlify will pick up the commit and render the static pages for this site.
