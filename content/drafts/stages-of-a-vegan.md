The Different Stages of a Vegan
I'm two years into my veganism journey.

I'm mostly writing this as a reminder of the subtle ways that gaining experience and insight can change your thought process.

It's a bit like discovering a new programming language. At first, it's all so foreign to you. The syntax is alien. You need to look up the documentation because you forgot the syntax for a plain function call. As you continue to use the language, you slowly forget what it's like to be a beginner. You forget the small things that gave you issues when starting out, but that are completely obvious now, even trivial.

That's why I'm writing this now, because I know in 10 years, when I'm that vegan yelling at everyone for the animal genocide, I can hopefully read this and remember that everyone is on a different path.

Pre-vegan life
Just complete ignorance about veganism. Everything I knew about it was wrong. I held the common misconceptions you might have heard and even believe yourself. Vegans are pussies. vegans can't lift weights. Vegans can't build muscle. Vegans are protein deficient.

Just living life, oblivious to this entire other vegan world that exists.
